# Changelog

## 1.4.0 (TBD)

- Deprecated the machine_option `use_private_ip_for_ssh`.  Replaced it with `transport_address_location` which can have an option
  of `:public_ip`, `:private_ip` or `:dns`.  Existing ManagedEntry references will be converted and the old value will be ignored
  if the new value is present.
- Added a configurable option for the number of times to retry [certain](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-ruby/blob/fb721a3ec3de2caabdb0ffa1f43bbe72b928f4ab/aws-sdk-core/lib/aws-sdk-core/plugins/retry_errors.rb) errors via the AWS SDK.  Add `chef_provisioning({:aws_retry_limit => 25})` to your `client.rb` to configure this.  Additionally, see [this documentation](https://github.com/chef/chef-provisioning/blob/master/docs/blogs/2012-05-28-machine_batch.html.markdown#max_simultaneous) in chef-provisioning for how to configure the `max_simultaneous` attribute on the machine_batch to limit the threads we use for making SDK requests.
- Refactored tagging logic.  Made implementation more straightforward and made interface more consistent.
  - For resource authors it should be easier to tag the managed AWS object.  Include the `Chef::Provisioning::AWSDriver::AWSTaggable` module on your resource to introduce the `aws_tags` attribute.  This is a hash which expects to receive a single layer of key -> value tags where value is nilable.  Some AWS services do not support nilable tags so will automatically convert nil value to an empty string.
  - The `AWSProvider` base class automatically tries to call a `converge_tags` method on the provider.  Add this method to your provider.  This method should create an `AWSTagger` instance and provide it a strategy that knows how to use an individual AWS client to tag the object.  For example, an RDS provider will have the following methods:
  ```ruby
  def aws_tagger
    @aws_tagger ||= begin
      rds_strategy = Chef::Provisioning::AWSDriver::TaggingStrategy::RDS.new(
        new_resource.driver.rds.client,
        construct_arn(new_resource),
        new_resource.aws_tags
      )
      Chef::Provisioning::AWSDriver::AWSTagger.new(rds_strategy, action_handler)
    end
  end
  def converge_tags
    aws_tagger.converge_tags
  end
  ```
  The `aws_tagger` method is used by the test framework to assert that the tags are correct.  Every `TaggingStrategy` should take 3 initialization parameters - a client to use for tagging, a primary key for the object being tagged, and the desired tags as a single layer hash.
  - There are 3 standard tests for taggable objects - 1) Tags can be created on a new object, 2) Tags can be updated on an existing object with tags and 3) Tags can be cleared by setting `aws_tags {}`.  These tests are all very similar between spec files but are copy-pastaed around for now.

- Added support for tags across almost all resources.  See the README for examples ([#190][])

## 1.1.1 (4/28/2015)

- Fixed bug where refering to the same `machine` an an `aws_instance` would would raise a RuntimeError ([@patrick-wright][], [@tyler-ball][] [#191][])
- Added new `destroy_an_aws_object` matcher for use in integration tests ([@patrick-wright][] [#186][])
- Add ability to turn off source/dest check ([@dblessing][])

- Added `aws_network_interface` resource ([@patrick-wright][] [#167][])
- Added integration tests which automatically destroy AWS resources after use ([@jkeiser][] [#152][])
- Added `action :purge` support on aws resources, will delete all dependent resources in addition to the current resource ([@jkeiser][] [@tyler-ball][] [#152][] [#187][])
  - EG, `action :purge` on the VPC will delete the subnet, machines, etc.
- Update `docs/examples` to be consistent with current codebase ([@msonnabaum][] [#181][] [#179][])
- Added version constraint for aws-sdk to support required features ([@msonnabaum][] [#178][])
- Updated `aws_ebs_volume` `:availability_zone` attribute to only require letter instead of full region and letter ([@patrick-wright][] [#185][])
  - IE, use `availability_zone 'a'` instead of `availability_zone 'us-east-1a'`
- Added AWS Proxy & Session Token Support ([@afiune][] [#177][])

- Existing AWS resources can be 'imported' (have a data bag managed entry created) by specifying their identifier in the resource's aws_id_attribute.  EG,
```ruby
aws_security_group "my_group" do
  security_group_id 'sg-123456'
end
```
([@jkeiser][])
- Updated `aws_vpc` to support an `internet_gateway true/false` flag ([@jkeiser][])
