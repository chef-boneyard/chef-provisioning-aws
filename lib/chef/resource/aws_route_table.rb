# `name` is not guaranteed unique for an AWS account; therefore, Chef will
# store the route table ID associated with this name in your Chef server in the
# data bag `data/aws_route_Table/<name>`.

  #
  # The VPC of this route table.
  #
  # May be one of:
  # - The name of an `aws_vpc` Chef resource.
  # - An actual `aws_vpc` resource.
  # - An AWS `VPC` object.

  # This is required for new route tables.

  # The routes for this route table.
  #
  # If specified, this must be a complete specification of all routes: it will
  # add any new routes and remove any old ones.
  #
  # This is in the form of a Hash, like so:
  #
  # ```ruby
  # main_routes '10.0.0.0/8' => 'internal_vpn',
  #             '0.0.0.0/0' => :internet_gateway
  # ```
  #
  # The destination (the left side of the `=>`) is always a CIDR block.
  # The target (the right side of the `=>`) can be one of several things:
  # - { internet_gateway: <AWS Internet Gateway ID or object> }
  # - { instance: <Chef machine name or resource, AWS Instance ID or object> }
  # - { network_interface: <AWS Network Interface ID or object> }
  # - <AWS Internet Gateway, Instance or Network Interface <ID or object)>
  # - Chef machine name
  # - Chef machine resource

  #
  # Regex to ignore one or more route targets.
  #
  # This is helpful when configuring HA NAT instances. If a NAT instance fails
  # a auto-scaling group may launch a new NAT instance and update the route
  # table accordingly. Chef provisioning should not attempt to change or remove
  # this route.
  #
  # This attribute is specified as a regex since the full ID of the
  # instance/network interface is not known ahead of time. In most cases the
  # NAT instance route will point at a network interface attached to the NAT
  # instance. The ID prefix for network interfaces is 'eni'. The following
  # example shows how to ignore network interface routes.
  #
  # ```ruby
  # ignore_route_targets ['^eni-']
  # ```
