#
# An AWS nat gateway, enable instances in a private subnet to connect to
# the Internet or other AWS services, but prevent the Internet from
# initiating a connection with those instances
#
# `name` is not guaranteed unique for an AWS account; therefore, Chef will
# store the nat gateway ID associated with this name in your Chef server in the
# data bag `data/aws_nat_gateway/<name>`.
#
# API documentation for the AWS Ruby SDK for Nat gateway can be found here:
#
# - http://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdkforruby/api/Aws/EC2/Types/NatGateway.html
#

# We provide this class because the AWS SDK V2 does not provide it (as of
# May 2016). We copied the pattern in their SDK so when they do add a real
# resource there shouldn't be a need for much translation.
